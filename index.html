        This document captures the differences between various HTML specifications.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This document describes the <em>perceptible</em> differences between three HTML
        specifications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href='http://whatwg.org/html'>WHATWG HTML LS</a> —
          The HTML Living Standard as maintained by the WHATWG
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href='http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/'>W3C HTML 5.1</a> —
          The HTML Nightly document, targeted for standardisation by W3C in 2016.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href='http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/CR/'>W3C HTML 5.0</a> —
          The HTML 5.0 document, currently in Candidate Recommendation and targeted for
          standardisation by W3C in 2014.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This document does not currently take into account
        <a href='http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/ExtensionSpecifications'>extension
        specifications</a> (longdesc, 2D context...) currently being developed by the HTML WG.
        They may be included in future updates after discussion in the working group.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Perceptible" differences are substantive changes but not editorial details. (Example:
        an attribute that's not present in one specification would be listed along with whatever
        other pieces of the specification that it affects, but its absence from the appendix
        would not be accounted for.)
      </p>
      <p>
        This document is updated on a regular basis based on the stream of commits made in the
        git repository. A more thorough update pass is made about every 6 months to ensure that
        nothing has been overlooked. Patches and bug reports are welcome at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        All differences are categorised as: "user agent" (for those that change UA behaviour),
        "validity" (that affect the validity of a document but not its behaviour), "author
        advice" (for non-normative advice given to authors but isn't typically validated for,
        usually because it's not possible), and "opinion" (the impact is unclear or hard to
        assess but the difference stems from disagreement nevertheless).
      </p>
      <p>
        Each difference has a rationale for its existence. The rationale is intended to be
        succinct (no need to rehash discussions taking place elsewhere) and to simply state its
        cause.
